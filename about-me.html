            <h2>My name is Apeksha Rajput and turning my thoughts and feelings into poetry was the best decision I've
                made.</h2>

            <p>Hey there! Life hasn't always been smooth sailing for me. I've had my fair share of ups and downs, and at
                one point, I started questioning the whole hustle for success and material things. It felt like there
                had to be more to life, you know? Money, success, chasing after happiness—it all seemed a bit empty at
                times.</p>

            <p>That's when I discovered the magic of poetry. Pouring out my thoughts and feelings into verses became my
                therapy, my way of making sense of the chaos. It helped me make sense of everything going on inside my
                head and heart.</p>

            <p>Along the way, I've been lucky to have some amazing people by my side. They've been like guiding stars,
                helping me stay on track and reminding me that I'm not alone in this crazy journey.</p>

            <p>Nowadays, things feel different. I've found a new sense of purpose, a deeper meaning to life. Sure Life's
                still hectic, but I handle it better.</p>

            <p><strong>So why do I write? </strong><br> Well, My journey taught me a lot, and I wanted to share it with
                others. Maybe my words can offer a glimmer of hope to someone who's going through their own rough patch.
            </p>

            <p>So that's me—a regular person, just trying to figure it all out one poem at a time. And hey, if you ever
                need someone to talk to or just want to swap stories, I'm all ears. Let's navigate this crazy ride
                called life together, shall we?</p>

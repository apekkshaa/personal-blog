                    <p class="article-body">What many broken people look for to make a new start?<br>
                        a blank page is a new story waiting to be written,<br>
                        a life waiting to be lived,<br>
                        and a masterpiece waiting to be crafted.<br><br>
                        Art is a whole other story,<br>
                        for every stroke creates one piece of something<br>
                        that has never been made before,<br>
                        no matter how detailed one can replicate,<br>
                        each is new<br>
                        as each person is new.<br><br>
                        In reality, everything we know is made by people,<br>
                        this is because even things made by god,<br>
                        were polluted by people.<br>
                        Who knows if god wanted the sky named 'sky'.<br><br>
                        in reality, nothing is reality.<br>
                        its all a concept.<br>
                        and not all of these ideas can be written.<br><br>
                        everything seems dumb down to what we,<br>
                        who we consider the most advanced species,<br>
                        can understand.<br>
                        to me,<br>
                        it seems many animals can get by with<br>
                        just knowing that when it is dark they sleep,<br>
                        and when it is light they get up.<br><br>
                        my point is that if,<br>
                        humans can turn beauty into false concepts,<br>
                        people are too a false concept.<br><br>
                        who are humans?<br>
                        some say we are homosapiens,<br>
                        I say we are beings,<br>
                        all trying to find a purpose in a broken society,<br>
                        broken by us.<br><br>
                        why is that in an attempt to educate our young,<br>
                        we stress them out past levels of asylums just a century ago.<br>
                        I don't see what the point of creating a world where people are unhappy is.<br>
                        and then, they don't allow for an escape from it.<br>
                        their personal sad and insanity entertainment.<br><br>
                        our only escape is death,<br>
                        and suicide is looked down upon.<br>
                        what does the society expect us to do?<br>
                        talk to other people?<br>
                        the root cause of the world's negatives.<br>
                        when I say it would be easier to die, its the truth.<br>
                        death is the easy way out,<br>
                        and yet why does it feel so hard?<br>

                        I will always remember,<br>
                        The first time we hung out,<br>

                        Our first kiss,<br>
                        And how your lips felt against mine,<br>
                        The first time you told me that you loved me,<br>

                        the tears pour down<br>
                        and I can't tell if they're lying.<br>
                        I feel an emptiness deep inside<br>
                        knowing I should be doing alright.<br><br>

                        There are days where I paint on a smile,<br>
                        make it through the day<br>
                        by laughing a little louder,<br>
                        I know if I ever dare stop for a while<br>
                        I will feel it in full force and I'll breakdown.<br><br>

                        Too much noise filling my head all the time,<br>
                        I try to scream<br>
                        but it's buried deep inside.<br>
                        I fear if I don't speak up soon<br>
                        I'll be lost to the war no-one else can see.<br>

                        It recalls there being something warm and infectious<br>
                        When the beat had purpose beyond mere survival<br>
                        A throbbing and pulsating that gave power to emotions<br><br>

                        My mind glimpses a past that held joyous moments<br>
                        It recalls there being sensation and fire in my core<br>
                        When every dream and hope had shape and form<br>
                        A memory made and cherished immune to times' flow<br><br>

                        My body longs for the thrills it once knew young<br>
                        It recalls the dexterity lost through its aches and pains<br>
                        When pleasures could be made through another's touch<br>
                        A yearning for something that ageing stole in the night<br><br>

                        My soul cries for the sake of heart, mind and body<br>
                        It recalls the strength of being someone made whole<br>
                        When joy, happiness and love were something real<br>
                        A time when life was all and ending was so far away<br><br>
